# GrafiteAI Project Documentation

## Project Overview

GrafiteAI is an AI-powered educational tutor specifically designed to help JEE and NEET aspirants develop better problem-solving thinking processes. Unlike traditional solution providers, GrafiteAI focuses on guiding students through the conceptual understanding and methodology rather than providing direct answers.

## Project Background

The original project was developed by a JEE/NEET aspirant who identified a gap in how students approach problem-solving. Instead of just getting answers, students need to develop the thinking process that leads to solutions. The project gained significant traction on Reddit's r/JEENEETards community before going offline due to high traffic.

## Core Philosophy

**"Don't expect exact answers - expect to think better"**

The AI tutor is designed to:
- Provide formulas and relevant concepts
- Explain the WHY behind solution steps
- Guide students through logical reasoning
- Leave actual calculations to the student
- Foster independent thinking and problem-solving skills

## Technical Architecture

### Current Implementation (Original)
- **Model**: RAG-based system using Llama-70B (with plans to migrate to DeepSeek/Qwen2.5-Math)
- **Embedding Model**: DistilBERT-base-NLI-mean-tokens
- **Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Dataset**: 56,570 curated JEE and NEET questions
- **Hosting**: Originally at grafite.in/ai

### Why RAG Over Fine-tuning?

The original developer attempted fine-tuning but encountered GPU memory limitations (CUDA out of memory error). RAG was chosen as a more resource-efficient alternative that:
- Requires less computational resources
- Provides contextual information retrieval
- Maintains flexibility without extensive retraining
- Allows for easier content updates and scaling

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) aspirants
- NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) aspirants
- Students preparing for competitive exams in India
- Self-learners seeking conceptual understanding

### Beneficiary Groups
- **2026/27 Batch Students**: Primary target demographic
- **Average Performers**: Students who need conceptual clarity over rote learning
- **Independent Learners**: Those who prefer understanding over memorization

## Key Features

### Educational Approach
- **Concept-First Learning**: Emphasizes understanding over memorization
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Breaks down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Formula Integration**: Provides relevant formulas with contextual application
- **Reasoning Development**: Builds logical thinking patterns

### User Experience
- **Free Access**: Completely free platform for all users
- **Interactive Learning**: Conversational AI interface
- **Question Database**: Large repository of JEE/NEET questions
- **Responsive Design**: Web-based interface accessible across devices

## Business Model

### Current Status
- **Completely Free**: No monetization strategy implemented
- **Community-Driven**: Built for and by the student community
- **Open Usage**: No registration or payment barriers

### Sustainability Considerations
- High server costs due to AI model inference
- Traffic management challenges (original project went down due to high usage)
- Need for robust infrastructure to handle peak loads

## Market Opportunity

### Problem Statement
- Traditional tutoring focuses on answer delivery rather than process development
- Students lack platforms that build thinking methodology
- Expensive coaching institutes create accessibility barriers
- Limited personalized guidance for average performers

### Competitive Advantages
- **Process-Oriented Learning**: Unique focus on thinking development
- **Free Access**: No financial barriers for students
- **Specialized Content**: Curated for JEE/NEET specifically
- **Community Trust**: Built by and for the target community

## Technical Challenges & Lessons Learned

### Infrastructure Challenges
- **High Traffic Handling**: Original project experienced server crashes due to overwhelming demand
- **API Rate Limiting**: Need for proper traffic management and rate limiting
- **Cost Management**: AI inference costs can escalate quickly with high usage

### Technical Decisions
- **RAG vs Fine-tuning**: RAG chosen for resource efficiency despite some trade-offs
- **Model Selection**: Llama-70B provides good balance of capability and cost
- **Embedding Strategy**: DistilBERT for efficient semantic search

## Revival Strategy

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Scalable Hosting**: Cloud infrastructure capable of handling traffic spikes
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers
- **CDN Integration**: Faster content delivery globally
- **Monitoring Systems**: Real-time performance and usage tracking

### Feature Enhancements
- **User Analytics**: Track learning patterns and effectiveness
- **Progress Tracking**: Help students monitor their conceptual development
- **Subject Categorization**: Better organization of questions by topics
- **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile experience

### Community Engagement
- **Feedback Loops**: Regular user feedback collection and implementation
- **Community Features**: Discussion forums, peer learning opportunities
- **Success Stories**: Showcase student achievements and improvements

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Daily active users
- Session duration and depth
- Question interaction rates
- User retention over time

### Educational Impact
- Conceptual understanding improvement
- Problem-solving confidence increase
- Academic performance correlation
- User testimonials and feedback

### Technical Performance
